# Project Kogs

A bunch of libraries and frameworks for game development in Kotlin based on [LittleKt](https://github.com/littlektframework/littlekt). Key differences:
* focus mostly on web builds, with little to no maintance on any other build targets
* keep using OpenGL (WebGL2 for web builds, ES 3.0 for JVM)
* slighly enchanced audio support (with spacial features from WebAudio)
